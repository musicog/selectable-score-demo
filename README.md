# TROMPA Selectable Score Demo application

![Screenshot demonstrating selectable score](selectable-score.png)

This repository contains a minimal example React application integrating the TROMPA [selectable-score](https://github.com/trompamusic/selectable-score) React component. To run it, clone this repository, then:
```
cd selectable-score-demo
npm install
npm start
```

Now point your web browser at https://localhost:8080. Wait a few moments for [Verovio](http://www.verovio.org) to render the score. 

Click and drag to select MEI elements (in this example, notes); hold down shift or ctrl to select discontinuous regions.

This application expects your Solid POD to have a folder called /public/annotations. At the moment, it is necessary to create this yourself using the Solid UI. This will be automated in future versions.


## Known issues

Paging is currently very slow. We're working on improving this, through [MELD](https://github.com/oerc-music/meld)  optimisations and potentially by running Verovio as a Web Worker (work in progress!)
